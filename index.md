## What
A very small chess program.

## The Book of Lean

In the beginning David Horne created [1K ZX Chess][1kchess]. And 1K Chess ran on ZX81, and it was 672 bytes long; and all saw that it was good.

And the land had rest 20H years. And Olivier Poudade begat a [program][bootchess], and he called its name BootChess. And BootChess ran on x86, and it was 468 bytes long; and all saw that it was boot.

And Óscar Toledo Gutiérrez begat a [program][atomchess], and it was a true Boot Chess. And he called its name Atomchess, saying, Atom is the smallest of particles. And it ran on x86, and all saw that it was good. And it came to pass, that men came and made Atomchess smaller; and it was 383 bytes long.

And Alex Garcia begat a [program][chesskelet], and it ran on ZX Spectrum. And he called its name ChesSkelet, saying, After all fat is trimmed, only the skeleton remains. And men came and made ChesSkelet smaller, and it was 352 bytes long.
